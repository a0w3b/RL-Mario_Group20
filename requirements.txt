# Gym and Mario environment
gym==0.26.2
gym-super-mario-bros==7.3.0
nes-py==8.2.1

# Optional but recommended
pygame>=2.5.0
# gym-retro is optional and may not be needed for this project

# Note: Using opencv-python-headless instead of opencv-python for better compatibility
# with numpy < 2.0.0 (required by gym). For GUI features, you can use opencv-python,
# but you'll need to use numpy >= 2.0.0 and gymnasium instead of gym.
